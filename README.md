| [AuthenticationControllerTest.kt](https://github.com/MartinDevStudent/healthtrackerrest/blob/main/src/test/kotlin/ie/setu/controllers/AuthenticationControllerTest.kt)           | The `AuthenticationControllerTest` class, with tests structured in a `ReadAuthentication` inner class, validates the authentication behavior of a REST API. It sets up a clean state by ensuring no pre-existing user with the test email, uses helper utilities to communicate with the server, and tests two scenarios: one where login with incorrect credentials (expected 401 unauthorized status) and one with correct credentials (expected 200 OK status) are attempted. Post-assertion cleanup removes test users to maintain database integrity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| [MealControllerTest.kt](https://github.com/MartinDevStudent/healthtrackerrest/blob/main/src/test/kotlin/ie/setu/controllers/MealControllerTest.kt)                               | The `MealControllerTest` in a Kotlin-based health tracker REST API performs integration tests on CRUD operations relating to meals. It uses a helper class to make requests and authenticate via JWT. It first ensures a test user is created and authenticated. Nested classes `ReadMeals`, `CreateMeals`, and `DeleteMeals` group tests for fetching (asserting responses 200 or 404), adding (with validation checks and asserting responses 201, 400, or 409), and deleting meals (by meal or user id, asserting responses 204 or 404). Cleanup ensures database state restoration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [ActivityControllerTest.kt](https://github.com/MartinDevStudent/healthtrackerrest/blob/main/src/test/kotlin/ie/setu/controllers/ActivityControllerTest.kt)                       | The `ActivityControllerTest` class, contained within the `healthtrackerrest` project, includes integration tests for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations related to `Activity` objects through HTTP requests. It leverages fixtures and JUnit `@Nested` classes to organize tests into meaningful groups. Tests ensure:-Successful creation of activities when the correct user exists, and appropriate HTTP status codes (201 for success, 400/404 for user-related failures).-Retrieval of activities either by activity ID or user ID, checking for success (200) or absence (404) of the data.-Updating existing activities with new details, confirming success (204) or failure (400) based on the activity's existence.-Deletion of activities and validating the returns of 204 for successful deletion or 404 when activity is not found.This is done after setting up a known state by creating test users and fetching authentication tokens. The test environment's state is restored by cleaning up newly created records after each test. |
| [UserControllerTest.kt](https://github.com/MartinDevStudent/healthtrackerrest/blob/main/src/test/kotlin/ie/setu/controllers/UserControllerTest.kt)                               | The `UserControllerTest` class performs integration tests on user management endpoints of a web service, using predefined valid and non-existing user details. Tests include checking responses for retrieving all users, individual user by ID or email, adding, updating, and deleting a user. Each test ensures the correct HTTP status codes are returned (200 for successful retrieval, 201/204 for successful creation/update/deletion, and 404 for not found). User authentication is handled by fetching a JWT token before tests, and database cleanup is performed to maintain a consistent test environment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [HealthTrackerControllerTestMockDB.kt](https://github.com/MartinDevStudent/healthtrackerrest/blob/main/src/test/kotlin/ie/setu/controllers/HealthTrackerControllerTestMockDB.kt) | The `HealthTrackerControllerTestMockDB` class is designed to test the HealthTrackerController using an in-memory H2 database, simulating api interactions. It initializes the mock database, populates it with a user, and tests the API endpoint for retrieving a user by email. The test verifies successful user creation, user retrieval by email after login, and matching of expected values in the user object received by ensuring correct HTTP response statuses and user details consistency.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| [IngredientControllerTest.kt](https://github.com/MartinDevStudent/healthtrackerrest/blob/main/src/test/kotlin/ie/setu/controllers/IngredientControllerTest.kt)                   | This Kotlin test suite validates the operations of an IngredientController within a health tracker RESTful service. It uses a Database Configuration, JWT authentication, and an HTTP server mock-up to perform integration tests. Before tests, it sets up a test user and fetches an authentication token. The tests cover retrieving all ingredients, handling non-existent ingredients or meals, obtaining ingredients by meal ID, and fetching recommended daily allowances. It asserts the correct HTTP response status codes, indicating successful operations or correct handling of missing resources.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| [AuthenticationController.kt](https://github.com/MartinDevStudent/healthtrackerrest/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/ie/setu/controllers/AuthenticationController.kt)                   | The `AuthenticationController` is a Kotlin singleton managing authentication for a REST service. It provides a `login` function that authenticates users against a user data access object, issues JWTs on successful login, and rejects unauthorized attempts with an error. Another function, `validate`, checks a JWT from the request, replies with a greeting on success, or responds with an unauthorized status in case of failure. The service integrates with Javalin's HTTP context for request-response handling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| [IngredientController.kt](https://github.com/MartinDevStudent/healthtrackerrest/blob/main/src/main/kotlin/ie/setu/controllers/IngredientController.kt)                           | The `IngredientController` singleton in Kotlin facilitates three REST operations related to ingredients and nutritional data. First, it fetches and sends a list of all ingredients in JSON, defaulting to a 404 error if none are found.

It allows adding users with a hidden form that becomes visible upon clicking a button. Each user can be updated or deleted, with a confirmation prompt for deletion. The component interacts with an API for CRUD operations, using an auth token from localStorage. It fetches users on creation and handles errors, specifically redirecting to login on 401 unauthorized responses. Users are displayed with links to their profiles, and CRUD changes update the UI in real-time.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| [login-page.vue](https://github.com/MartinDevStudent/healthtrackerrest/blob/main/src/main/resources/vue/views/login-page.vue)                             | The given Vue.js component login-page renders a login form with email and password fields if a token is present in the store. It defines a method `login` to authenticate users via an API, setting a token in the store and local storage upon success. Alerts notify the user of either successful login, invalid details, or login errors.

| [activity-profile.vue](https://github.com/MartinDevStudent/healthtrackerrest/blob/main/src/main/resources/vue/views/activity-profile.vue)                 | The given Vue.js component provides an interface for viewing and editing an individual activity record in a health tracker application. If the activity is not found, a message is displayed with a link to view all activities. When an activity is present, it displays a form with the activity's ID, description, duration, calories burned, start time, and user ID. Users can update or delete the activity using respective buttons, which trigger API calls for patching or deleting the activity, requiring authorization via a token. On deletion confirmation, the user is redirected to an overview of all activities.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [register-page.vue](https://github.com/MartinDevStudent/healthtrackerrest/blob/main/src/main/resources/vue/views/register-page.vue)                       | The Vue.js component `register-page` inside a health tracking app's RESTful service provides a user registration form with fields for name, email, and password. Upon submission, it makes an asynchronous POST request to /api/login/register with the form data. If successful, it alerts the user that the account is created and redirects to the login page. If an error occurs, it parses the problem details and displays them in an alert. The repository includes GitHub Actions workflows for Maven deployment and pull requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| [user-activity-overview.vue](https://github.com/MartinDevStudent/healthtrackerrest/blob/main/src/main/resources/vue/views/user-activity-overview.vue)     | The `user-activity-overview.vue` component displays a list of activities for a user within a web application. It retrieves activities from a REST API, which requires an authorization token. When created, it fetches the token from local storage and the user's activities by making an authenticated request. If unauthorized (401 error), it redirects to the login page; otherwise, it alerts the user about any error during the fetch. The activities are listed showing their ID, description, and duration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| [meal-ingredient-overview.vue](https://github.com/MartinDevStudent/healthtrackerrest/blob/main/src/main/resources/vue/views/meal-ingredient-overview.vue) | The provided Vue.js component displays a list of ingredients for a meal. It is initially populated with an empty list and a null token. Upon creation, it retrieves an authentication token from local storage and fetches the meal's ingredients from an API, using the meal ID from the URL path parameters. Fetched ingredients are then displayed in a list. If any error occurs, particularly an authentication error (401), the user is redirected to the login page; otherwise, an error alert is shown. The component is part of a health tracker application with GitHub workflows for Maven deployment and pull request checks, and includes separate source and test directories for Kotlin code.                                                                                                    |
| [meal-overview.vue](https://github.com/MartinDevStudent/healthtrackerrest/blob/main/src/main/resources/vue/views/meal-overview.vue)                       | The Vue component meal-overview provides an interface for viewing, adding, and deleting meal entries. It retrieves a list of meals and a token upon initialization, displays the meals, and allows users to add new meals via an input form which is shown or hidden based on user interaction. Users can update meal entries by navigating to the meal-specific URL or delete them with confirmation. The component handles errors gracefully by redirecting to the login page for unauthorized requests or displaying a validation error message.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

| [app-layout.vue](https://github.com/MartinDevStudent/healthtrackerrest/blob/main/src/main/resources/vue/components/app-layout.vue) | The provided code snippet is a Vue.js single-file component definition for a web application's layout, including a navigation bar and a content area. It comes from a health tracker application's frontend, structured within a Kotlin-based project using Javalin, and incorporates CI/CD workflows for Maven in the `.github` directory. The navbar enables navigation to different pages (Home, Users, Activities, Meals, Ingredients) and offers Login/Register or Logout functionality based on the presence of a `token` (presumably for authentication purposes). The `token` is managed in local storage and is checked or removed on component creation or when logging out, respectively. The main content area below the navbar is dynamically filled with child components through the `<slot>` tag. The navbar's styling is specified at the end. |

| [mvn-pull-request.yml](https://github.com/MartinDevStudent/healthtrackerrest/blob/main/.github/workflows/mvn-pull-request.yml) | The GitHub Actions workflow in `mvn-pull-request.yml` defines three jobs to automate processes for pull requests targeting the master branch or any push not to master. It prepares a Maven package skipping tests, runs tests after packaging, and generates KDoc documentation. It uses an Ubuntu runner with JDK 17. The first job builds JAR artifacts without tests. The second runs tests, dependent on the packaging job. The third generates and archives KDoc documentation, also dependent on the packaging job. |
| [mvn-deploy.yml](https://github.com/MartinDevStudent/healthtrackerrest/blob/main/.github/workflows/mvn-deploy.yml)             | The provided GitHub Actions workflow (`mvn-deploy.yml`) defines a continuous deployment pipeline for a Kotlin-based Maven project to Railway upon pushes to the master branch. It consists of four jobs: packaging without tests, running tests, generating documentation with Dokka, and deploying to Railway. The packaging job also archives the JAR files, and the documentation job archives the KDoc site. The deployment job is dependent on the successful completion of the tests.                                |
